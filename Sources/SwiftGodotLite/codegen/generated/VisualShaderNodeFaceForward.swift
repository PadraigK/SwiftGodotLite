/// Returns the vector that points in the same direction as a reference vector within the visual shader graph.
/// 
/// Translates to `faceforward(N, I, Nref)` in the shader language. The function has three vector parameters: `N`, the vector to orient, `I`, the incident vector, and `Nref`, the reference vector. If the dot product of `I` and `Nref` is smaller than zero the return value is `N`. Otherwise, `-N` is returned.
