/// Imports a MP3 audio file for playback.
/// 
/// MP3 is a lossy audio format, with worse audio quality compared to ``ResourceImporterOggVorbis`` at a given bitrate.
/// 
/// In most cases, it's recommended to use Ogg Vorbis over MP3. However, if you're using a MP3 sound source with no higher quality source available, then it's recommended to use the MP3 file directly to avoid double lossy compression.
/// 
/// MP3 requires more CPU to decode than ``ResourceImporterWAV``. If you need to play a lot of simultaneous sounds, it's recommended to use WAV for those sounds instead, especially if targeting low-end devices.
