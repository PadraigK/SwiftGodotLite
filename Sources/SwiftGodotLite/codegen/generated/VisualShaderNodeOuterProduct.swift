/// Calculates an outer product of two vectors within the visual shader graph.
/// 
/// `OuterProduct` treats the first parameter `c` as a column vector (matrix with one column) and the second parameter `r` as a row vector (matrix with one row) and does a linear algebraic matrix multiply `c * r`, yielding a matrix whose number of rows is the number of components in `c` and whose number of columns is the number of components in `r`.
