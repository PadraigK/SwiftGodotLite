/// This is the default ``MultiplayerAPI/multiplayerPeer`` for the ``Node/multiplayer``. It mimics the behavior of a server with no peers connected.
/// 
/// This means that the ``SceneTree`` will act as the multiplayer authority by default. Calls to ``MultiplayerAPI/isServer()`` will return `true`, and calls to ``MultiplayerAPI/getUniqueId()`` will return ``MultiplayerPeer/``targetPeerServer````.
