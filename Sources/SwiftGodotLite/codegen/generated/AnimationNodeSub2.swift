/// Blends two animations subtractively inside of an ``AnimationNodeBlendTree``.
/// 
/// A resource to add to an ``AnimationNodeBlendTree``. Blends two animations subtractively based on the amount value.
/// 
/// This animation node is usually used for pre-calculation to cancel out any extra poses from the animation for the "add" animation source in ``AnimationNodeAdd2`` or ``AnimationNodeAdd3``.
/// 
/// In general, the blend value should be in the `[0.0, 1.0]` range, but values outside of this range can be used for amplified or inverted animations.
/// 
/// > Note: This calculation is different from using a negative value in ``AnimationNodeAdd2``, since the transformation matrices do not satisfy the commutative law. ``AnimationNodeSub2`` multiplies the transformation matrix of the inverted animation from the left side, while negative ``AnimationNodeAdd2`` multiplies it from the right side.
