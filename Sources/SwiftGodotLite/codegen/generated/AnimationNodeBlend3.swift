/// Blends two of three animations linearly inside of an ``AnimationNodeBlendTree``.
/// 
/// A resource to add to an ``AnimationNodeBlendTree``. Blends two animations out of three linearly out of three based on the amount value.
/// 
/// This animation node has three inputs:
/// 
/// - The base animation to blend with
/// 
/// - A "-blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative value
/// 
/// - A "+blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive value
/// 
/// In general, the blend value should be in the `[-1.0, 1.0]` range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified animations, however, ``AnimationNodeAdd3`` works better for this purpose.
