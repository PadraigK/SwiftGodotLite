/// A 3D world boundary shape, intended for use in physics. ``WorldBoundaryShape3D`` works like an infinite plane that forces all physics bodies to stay above it. The ``plane``'s normal determines which direction is considered as "above" and in the editor, the line over the plane represents this direction. It can for example be used for endless flat floors.
