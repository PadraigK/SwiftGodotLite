/// Abstract class for all Tweeners used by ``Tween``.
/// 
/// Tweeners are objects that perform a specific animating task, e.g. interpolating a property or calling a method at a given time. A ``Tweener`` can't be created manually, you need to use a dedicated method from ``Tween``.
/// 
/// 
/// This object emits the following signals:
/// 
/// - ``finished``
open class Tweener: RefCounted {
    override open class var godotClassName: StringName { "Tweener" }
    // Signals 
    /// Emitted when the ``Tweener`` has just finished its job.
    ///
    /// To connect to this signal, reference this property and call the
    /// 
    /// `connect` method with the method you want to invoke
    /// 
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// obj.finished.connect {
    ///    print ("caught signal")
    /// }
    /// ```
    public var finished: SimpleSignal { SimpleSignal (target: self, signalName: "finished") }
    
}
