/// Base class for ``AnimationNode``s that hold one or multiple composite animations. Usually used for ``AnimationTree/treeRoot``.
/// 
/// ``AnimationRootNode`` is a base class for ``AnimationNode``s that hold a complete animation. A complete animation refers to the output of an ``AnimationNodeOutput`` in an ``AnimationNodeBlendTree`` or the output of another ``AnimationRootNode``. Used for ``AnimationTree/treeRoot`` or in other ``AnimationRootNode``s.
/// 
/// Examples of built-in root nodes include ``AnimationNodeBlendTree`` (allows blending nodes between each other using various modes), ``AnimationNodeStateMachine`` (allows to configure blending and transitions between nodes using a state machine pattern), ``AnimationNodeBlendSpace2D`` (allows linear blending between **three** ``AnimationNode``s), ``AnimationNodeBlendSpace1D`` (allows linear blending only between **two** ``AnimationNode``s).
