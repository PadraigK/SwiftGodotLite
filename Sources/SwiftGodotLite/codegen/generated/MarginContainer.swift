/// A container that keeps a margin around its child controls.
/// 
/// ``MarginContainer`` adds an adjustable margin on each side of its child controls. The margins are added around all children, not around each individual one. To control the ``MarginContainer``'s margins, use the `margin_*` theme properties listed below.
/// 
/// > Note: The margin sizes are theme overrides, not normal properties. This is an example of how to change them in code:
/// 
open class MarginContainer: Container {
    override open class var godotClassName: StringName { "MarginContainer" }
}
