/// This animation node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-children of the animation graph. Use to play an ``Animation`` from the start or a certain playback position inside the ``AnimationNodeBlendTree``.
/// 
/// After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the time seek node automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its `seek_request` value to `-1.0`.
