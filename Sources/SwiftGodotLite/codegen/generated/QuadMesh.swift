/// Class representing a square mesh facing the camera.
/// 
/// Class representing a square ``PrimitiveMesh``. This flat mesh does not have a thickness. By default, this mesh is aligned on the X and Y axes; this rotation is more suited for use with billboarded materials. A ``QuadMesh`` is equivalent to a ``PlaneMesh`` except its default ``PlaneMesh/orientation`` is ``PlaneMesh/Orientation/faceZ``.
open class QuadMesh: PlaneMesh {
    override open class var godotClassName: StringName { "QuadMesh" }
