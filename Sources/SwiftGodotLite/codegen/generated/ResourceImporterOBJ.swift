/// Imports an OBJ 3D model as a standalone ``Mesh`` or scene.
/// 
/// Unlike ``ResourceImporterScene``, ``ResourceImporterOBJ`` will import a single ``Mesh`` resource by default instead of importing a ``PackedScene``. This makes it easier to use the ``Mesh`` resource in nodes that expect direct ``Mesh`` resources, such as ``GridMap``, ``GPUParticles3D`` or ``CPUParticles3D``. Note that it is still possible to save mesh resources from 3D scenes using the **Advanced Import Settings** dialog, regardless of the source format.
/// 
/// See also ``ResourceImporterScene``, which is used for more advanced 3D formats such as glTF.
///

    override open class var godotClassName: StringName { "ResourceImporterOBJ" }
